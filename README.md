This is a minimal working example using [Documenter.jl](https://documenter.juliadocs.org/stable/) and [Literate.jl](https://fredrikekre.github.io/Literate.jl/v2/). The charts were prepared using [CairoMakie](https://makie.org/website/).

The package has no functionality, it is solely for the purposes of testing the documentation generation workflow.
